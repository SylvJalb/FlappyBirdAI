# FlappyBirdAI
AI playing to a Flappy Bird Clone using Reinforcement Learning

This project work with this [Flappy Bird Clone](https://github.com/sourabhv/FlapPyBird). I just made some changes in the code to make the graphics simpler than the original clone game.

## Installation
I'm using python 3.10.6 on Ubuntu 22.04    
I recommend to use a python virtual env, and installing the dependencies by the following commands:
``` bash
sudo apt install pkg-config libcairo2-dev gcc python3-dev libgirepository1.0-dev
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Follow the instructions in training_model.ipynb to train the model.      
Be sure the Flappy Bird game is running, and it's **fully visible** on the screen.
